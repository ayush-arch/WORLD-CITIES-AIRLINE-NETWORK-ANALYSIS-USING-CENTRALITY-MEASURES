The number of airports a country has is often considered as a direct measure of the flourishment and development
of its travel and trade sector, both of which are invaluable pillars of a nation's economic progress and development.

Airports are vital to every country and a major relation between countries is often identified by the number of flights
shared among them i.e. how many flights serve as a pathway between the two countries.
